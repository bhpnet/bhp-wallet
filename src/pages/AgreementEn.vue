You may manage your digital Tokens by using the transfer and receipt functionalities of BHP Wallet, i.e., you may revise the blockchain ledger by signing with your Private Key.

Such “transfer” of Tokens involves a validated record of such transaction on the distributed ledger of the relevant the blockchain system (rather than an actual delivery or transfer of Tokens on BHP Wallet).
